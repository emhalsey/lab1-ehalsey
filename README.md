Make sure to type your commands correctly, such as `d2b(100)` or `enc(Rap Monster)`. Otherwise, the program will not work as expected.

Initialize the program through the pi.cs.oswego.edu server by using `cc lab1-ehalsey.c -o lab1`, then activating it on the next line with `./lab1`. When it loads and you see your user ID with a `$` next to it, enter one of the following commands below.

* `d2b(int)`  | Convert decimal to binary.

* `b2d(binary)`  | Convert binary to decimal.

* `enc(string)`  | Encrypt user’s input based on Caesar’s cipher.

* `dec(encrypted string)`  | Decrypt user’s input based on Caesar’s cipher.

* `gcd(int)`  | Encode a number into a gamma code.

* `exit` | Exit the program.
